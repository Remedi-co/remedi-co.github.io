==What is the problem==
Medical devices are generally aimed for use in the developed world. In practice this means that technology is largely unavailable to the majority of the worlds population. This is either due to high cost, lack of resources or bad design for low-resource settings. Donated second hand medical equipment is part of this problem, as this equipment is not adapted for use in the local context, the required knowledge, skills and infrastructure to operate and maintain the devices are often not available.

==Co-creation==
The key to finding sustainable solutions is to adapt global working principles to the local context through co-creation with local medical professionals and patients. The majority of human body functions are identical around the world, therefor medical principals are equally applicable. But how these principals are applied and what requirements the devices have to meet, depends on the local context. Together with a local problem owner, makers and engineers from all around the globe are able to generate innovative designs and the internet enables this exchange of knowledge.

==Opportunity==
Not only should we feel obliged to make basic medical technology available around the world, it is also an opportunity to improve healthcare through frugal innovation. Solutions created in an environment of abundance are not always optimal, whereas low resource settings require resourceful and specific designs. This is an opportunity that is also acknowledged by the industry giants.

Furthermore, the rapid development of computer aided manufacturing methods like 3d printing create the possibility to quickly and easily adapt a design to local context.

==Technology is only part of the solution==
In the application of medical equipment it is very important that doctors and staff are well trained and capable to correctly apply technology. Therefor it is very important to work together with local problem owners, who see opportunity to solve their problem and are open to think about sustainable ways to implement a solution. The maker or engineer is a technical facilitator in the problem owner's process towards a sustainable solution. In this process the local problem owner needs to take responsibility for implementation of the technology.
